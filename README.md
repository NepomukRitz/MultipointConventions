# MultipointConventions

In this repository, different conventions used for computations of multipoint functions shall be summarized and linked to the corresponding papers which use them.
The main document is [``docs/index.md``](docs/index.md), which is built and deployed using [github pages](https://nepomukritz.github.io/MultipointConventions/).

Feel free to contribute!
